# Foundation 6 + Nunjucks templates

This is the basic starter project for [Foundation for Sites 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites). It includes a Sass compiler and a starter HTML file and [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) template building.

## Installation

To use this project, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.10 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


```bash
hg clone https://github.com/kushalj/foundation6-nunjucks.git
``` 

then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass+Nunjucks compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file or a template.
